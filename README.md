# Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection with Jetson Xavier NX

![Autonomous Vehicle Object Detection](autonomous_vehicle.jpg)

## Overview

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on real-time object classification and identification for safe and effective navigation. This project explores the potential of using edge computing and low-power processing units like the Jetson Xavier NX for object detection in AVs. We specifically consider the YOLO v8 deep learning model, one of the most advanced object identification models, and assess its compatibility with the Jetson board. Our goal is to provide guidance on integrating YOLO v8 with Jetson Xavier NX for edge computing in autonomous vehicles.

## Benefits and Drawbacks

### Benefits:
- **Edge Computing**: Utilizing the Jetson Xavier NX enables efficient edge computing, reducing latency and enhancing real-time processing capabilities.
- **Low-Power**: The low-power characteristics of Jetson make it suitable for onboard applications in AVs.
- **Object Detection**: YOLO v8 offers state-of-the-art object detection performance, crucial for AVs' safety.

### Drawbacks:
- **Development Challenges**: Integrating advanced models like YOLO v8 with Jetson may pose development challenges.
- **Resource Limitations**: Jetson Xavier NX has resource limitations compared to larger computing clusters.
- **Ongoing Research**: Continued research and development are necessary for ensuring the safe and responsible deployment of AVs with object detection capabilities.

## Model Compatibility

Our investigation suggests that YOLO v8 can be successfully implemented on Jetson Xavier. We achieved a mean average precision (mAP) as high as 93% and an F1 score of 89.29%. This demonstrates the potential for effective object detection in autonomous vehicles using this combination.
